## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes These Titles Sound Fake?

**From HIGH credibility sources:**
- Massive funding numbers ($220M, $750M)
- AI "deceiving" or "beating" other AI
- Subscription prices that seem absurd ($300/month)
- Companies with weird names raising huge amounts

**From MEDIUM credibility sources:**
- AGI/superintelligence predictions
- "Changed everything" hyperbole
- MouseGPT (wait, what?)
- Specific year predictions (2027, 2030)

**From MEDIUM-LOW credibility:**
- "Living viruses" created by AI
- "Definitive guides" to rapidly changing field
- Everything "changed" in one month
- Excessive use of "breakthrough"

**From LOW credibility:**
- SEO keyword stuffing ("unveiling astonishing ultimate")
- Apocalypse and doom language
- "Dumpster fire" in tech headlines
- "Frenzy" combined with "billion-dollar"

### The Surprising Truth
Even articles from **TechCrunch and VentureBeat** sound fake because:
1. AI funding rounds ARE that big now
2. Companies with one-letter names DO raise $220M
3. AI models DO exhibit deceptive behavior (per research)
4. Some companies ARE charging $300/month

**Reality in AI has become indistinguishable from clickbait.**
